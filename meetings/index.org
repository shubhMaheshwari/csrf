- Title(for now?): Modeling and Mitigation of csrf attacks on FIM

- TODOs:
  - Find sites made intentionally vulnerable to csrf, and check if corp can protect

  - Look for alternate workflows in FIM(actual websites), and check if CORP can
    mitigate: essentially check the boundaries of CORP's capabilities and
    application  to multiple styles of FIM.

Sections to be kept separate in paper
- Modeling
- Experimentation
